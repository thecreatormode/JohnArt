      <h1>I am a comic artist.</h1>
      <p>I remember when I first picked up a crayon, I didn’t understand the concept of drawing yet. I was still in
my childhood home, babbling and scribbling on the walls. My grandma would yell at me to stop but she
wouldn’t wash the drawings away. Secretly, she was fond of them. I had to be around three or four
years old at the time. I didn’t know what I was doing, only that it was fun. Every single one of my
notebooks from elementary school to university is filled to the brim of doodles I drew when I got bored,
or inspired, or stressed. I’ve attended every single drawing, sketching and painting class that my mother
could afford. <br> <br> Art is more than just an activity to me. Art is the biggest and most significant aspect of my
life. Without it, I wouldn’t be who I am or have gotten to where I am. It’s a pity that most people tell me
that they can’t draw or want to learn but know they aren’t good at drawing. It hurts when I see talented
artists give up because they must “focus on more realistic dreams”. It’s a shame when hard working
animators for award-winning shows are underpaid and undervalued with their projects suddenly
cancelled for no reason. I would like to live in a world of beauty and wonder, with a proper appreciation
for the things that make this world a treasure to live in. That will be my mission until my last breath.</p>
